#=============React-leaflet does not work. If removed, the rest works.============
# testmap.js: Leaflet code
# test-base.js: render the React-leaflet to the <div id="map"></div> in the test-base.html

###
Steps to fix:
1. create a package.json that allows Webpack to resolve this directory as a "module" -
   that way, you can add your own dependencies such as webpack
2. Stay within the react system! That is, load the map as a react object
   _alongside_ your html rather than within it...

AdminBaseComponent = ->
  h 'div', [
    h Carto
    h Form

export default {
  landingText: h Markdown, {src: aboutText}
  siteTitle: 'Wisconsin Cosmo'

}
