## About the lab

Research in the Wisc Cosmogenic Nuclide Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison, directed by [Prof. Shaun Marcott](http://proglacial.com/), is focused on determining the age of geomorphic features on Earth’s surface using rare isotopes that are produced by cosmic ray interactions with rocks and minerals, including 10Be and 26Al. A primary focus of the lab is on dating the evolution of Earth’s cryosphere, through the analysis of minerals from Greenland, the eastern U.S., and western North America.

## Geochronology data system

The Wisc Cosmogenic Nuclide Lab is a partner in the
NSF EarthCube Geochronology Infrastructure project. This
[**Sparrow**](https://sparrow-data.org) lab information management system
is a product of that collaboration.
