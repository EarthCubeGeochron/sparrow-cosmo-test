## About the lab

Research in the _Wisc Cosmogenic Nuclide Lab_ at **University of Wisconsin-Madison**, directed by Prof. [**Shaun Marcott**](http://proglacial.com/), focuses on determining the age of geomorphic features on Earth’s surface using rare isotopes that are produced by cosmic ray interactions with rocks and minerals, including <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al. A primary focus of the lab is on dating the evolution of Earth’s cryosphere through the analysis of minerals from Greenland, the eastern U.S., and western North America.

## Geochronology data system

The _Wisc Cosmogenic Nuclide Lab_ is a partner in the
NSF EarthCube Geochronology Infrastructure project. This
[**Sparrow**](https://sparrow-data.org) lab information management system
is a product of this collaboration. Go to the [**submitting form**](/catalog).
